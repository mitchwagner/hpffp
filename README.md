# Haskell Programming From First Principles

This repository is functionally a personal recitation of the Haskell code found
in *Haskell Programming From First Principles* by Christopher Allen and Julie
Moronuki. It includes transcriptions of the code given in the text, as well as
solutions (perhaps refined via the use of other sources) to the various
exercises posed in the book.
